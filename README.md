Supply Chain Management Using Blockchain

Overview
This project leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient supply chain management system. By utilizing a decentralized ledger, the project ensures real-time tracking of goods, immutability of transaction records, and enhanced trust among stakeholders.

Features
- Decentralized Ledger: All transactions are recorded on a distributed blockchain, eliminating the need for a central authority.
- Real-Time Tracking: Track the movement and status of goods in real-time across the supply chain.
- Immutability: Transaction records are immutable and can be verified by all participants, ensuring data integrity.
- Smart Contracts: Automate agreements and processes with self-executing contracts, reducing manual intervention and errors.
- Enhanced Security: Blockchainâ€™s cryptographic nature ensures data security and reduces the risk of fraud.
- Transparency: All participants have access to a single source of truth, fostering trust and collaboration.

Technology Stack
- Blockchain Platform: [e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger]
- Smart Contracts: Written in [e.g., Solidity, Chaincode]
- Frontend: [e.g., React, Angular]
- Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express.js]
- Database: [e.g., MongoDB, IPFS for decentralized storage]

Use Cases
- Provenance Tracking: Track the origin and journey of products from the source to the consumer.
- Anti-Counterfeiting: Ensure the authenticity of goods by verifying their history on the blockchain.
- Supply Chain Finance: Facilitate faster payments and reduce the risk of fraud through transparent and automated processes.
